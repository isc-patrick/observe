    "# Writing Model Agnostic LLm applications with centralized Observability, Testing and Evaluation and Security\n",
    "In order to write LLM based applications that intend to be productionaized, there are a few important non-functional features that are critical for long term success. This demo notebook addresses some methods for handling two of the most critical of these features: \n",
    "1. Model agnostic code\n",
    "    a. 1. Different models need to be able to be used and tested by only making changes to a configuration. This must be done to avoid model lock-in, optimize accuracy and costs, and enable a path to model upgrades.\n",
    "2. Centralized observability\n",
    "    a. Testing and Evaluation\n",
    "       1. LLMs have a high sensitivity to change and exhibit a high degree of unpredictable side effects to change. Changes in the prompt, from development, new data, RAG context, etc... are unavoidable.\n",
    "   b. Security\n",
    "       1. Company level security checks are critical\n",
    "       2. Shared secutiry checks reduce redundancy and increase accountability\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model agnostic code is acheived in this demo by using the open source litellm library\n",
    "- Centralized Observability is acheived by using the open source langfuse libraries and application"
